				<h2>My origin:</h2>
				<p>
					<span>I</span> am from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. I was born in 1989, am 32 years old as of right now. I attended Myanmar 
					school system from kindergarder to highschool(grade 12). In 2015, I finised my high school and followed my dream job 
					as a electronic technician. I studied at an electronic workshop for one and half years. Then, I was graduated as 
					an electronic repair techinician. In my seventheen, I started my own business to repair, assemble, and help with customers.
					In my workshop, I repair computers, monitors, TVs, DVDplayers, radios, and etc.  
					In order to keep up with updated new technologies in my workplace, I started to learn how to speak and read in English. Moreover, I still need more knowledge on how business work for my own business. 
					For that reason, I worked as an electronic repair technician at the TCL electronic and appliance company to gain more knowlege 
					on how business function as a orginization and a workshop. In 2011, I immigrated to the United States of America. 
				</p>

				<h2>In United States:</h2>
				<p>
					<span>I</span>n 2011, I was 22 years old when I immigrated to the United States and landed to the New York city. I came here with a fiance visa and I got marry within 90 days with my wife. In term 
					of my career, I wanted to continue my speciality as an electronic repair technician in the United States. However, there are a lot of complication to be 
					a electrician in the United States. In bright side, I learned that there are some training programs which offers a certificate to become an electrician. So, I attended ESL class to get 
					my English skill to be ready for training programs. At the end of ESL term, I was recommanded to take a GED exam so I could pursute my career goal. In 2015, I graduede with a GED degree.
					At that time, I already know to become a computer software engineer. I attended Bronx Community College to pursute a associate degree in computer programming. In 2016, I moved to Pittsburgh and 
					continue my school at the Community College of Allegheny County(CCAC). In 2018, I graduated with a degree in Computer Information Systems from CCAC. In 2021, I received Bechalor degree in 
					Computer Science from Pitt.
